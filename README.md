# Hi, I’m Aryan Tripathi 👋  
**AI & ML Engineer | Industrial Automation | Full-Stack Python Developer**

I build **production-grade systems** that transform **industrial, unstructured (“dirty”) data** into **actionable intelligence**.  
My work focuses on **Computer Vision, Heuristic Data Engineering, and Predictive Analytics**, with tools **actively used in real industrial workflows**.
